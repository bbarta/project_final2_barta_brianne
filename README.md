# Resources
I used a lot of resources to help me with this project, however, many of them demonstarted media queries with max-widths, which I know we were advised not to use. I tried to get by using min-widths only, but I had some difficulty wrapping my head around everything. I think responsive design is something that I'll get better at with time.

I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments
I think I still have a bit to learn, but this was a great start/intro to responsive design. I hope to have it mastered by the final project.
